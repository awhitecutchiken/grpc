/**
 * Stub implementations for future stubs. Stub configuration is immutable; changing the
 * configuration returns a new stub with updated configuration. Changing the configuration is cheap
 * and may be done before every RPC, such as would be common when using {@link #withDeadlineAfter}.
 *
 * <p>Configuration is stored in {@link CallOptions} and is passed to the {@link Channel} when
 * performing an RPC.
 *
 * <p>DO NOT MOCK: Customizing options doesn't work properly in mocks. Use InProcessChannelBuilder
 * to create a real channel suitable for testing. It is also possible to mock Channel instead.
